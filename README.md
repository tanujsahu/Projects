# GymCatch - Angular
## Overview
This project focuses on the development of Gymcatch's booking, customer management, and listing service platforms. As an Angular Developer for 9 months, I contributed to creating two distinct platforms: one designed for business users and the other accessible to the general public. Our emphasis was on building proprietary libraries to maintain complete control over UI components without relying on third-party libraries.

## Role
* Company: Gymcatch
* Position: Angular Developer
* Duration: 9 Months

## Key Technologies and Methodologies
* 1. Custom Libraries - Developed proprietary NPM packages tailored to our specific design and functionality needs, ensuring a consistent and maintainable UI.
* 2. State Management with NgRx - Implemented NgRx for efficient state management, using actions, reducers, and selectors to facilitate a reactive programming model across the application.
* 3. Custom API Management - Established a separate project dedicated to managing API service calls, promoting a clean separation of concerns and optimizing the handling of network requests and responses.
* 4. Component Architecture - Utilized Angular’s component-based architecture to create reusable and maintainable UI elements, improving both development speed and user experience.
* 5. Advanced Angular Features - Leveraged lazy loading to optimize application performance by loading modules only when needed.
     Employed Angular’s AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation to enhance load times and overall runtime efficiency.

## Mission
At Gymcatch, our mission is to increase participation in fitness through innovative technology. By simplifying the process of finding and booking fitness activities, we encourage more people to engage in exercise and promote community wellness.
